## [Building APIs on Rails 5 with AMS](https://youtu.be/Kp5EHh-VEb0)

A lot of people have being using Rails to develop both their internal or external API, but building a high quality API can be hard, and performance is a key point to achieve it. I'll share my stories with APIs, and tell you how Active Model Serializer, component of Rails-API, helped me. AMS have being used across thousands of applications bringing convention over configuration to JSON generation. This talk will give you a sneak peek of a new version of AMS that we have being working on, it's new cache conventions, and how it's being considered to be shipped by default in new Rails 5.

## [Rust for Rubyist](https://youtu.be/sBkN513ShkQ)

Rust is an Open Source programming language, which started from a necessity from the Mozilla team to have a better (safer) language to develop a rendering engine for Firefox. We have some big names from Ruby Community "playing" with Rust, Steve Klabnik, Yehuda Katz and some others. Also Yehuda's company, Tilde, is adopting Rust in production for Skylight. Rust is definitely a different language when compared to Ruby, but still pretty interesting. I found myself interested on it to try something different. I believe that learning is an amazing process, and the act of learning something completely different is really helpful for you, because you can open you thinking to new ideas not explored by you yet. Rust done this to me and to my understanding of the Ruby language. In this talk, I want to present some key and basic concepts of Rust and also give some comparison with Ruby. Concepts of ownership, borrowing, immutability and a few other would be covered here, a long with some basic explanation of how Rust handles memory allocations. If you don't know Rust, no problem at all. Filipe will make an overview and answer questions.
