      <description>## How is it going with Remote Meetups?

It's been a while that you have logged in our Slack Channel. I would like to just to say how we are going and the latest updates!

### Now on BigMarker

Doing a Remote Meetup is a little bit difficult, because users report don't have the same feeling as a real meetup. For this reason, We were looking for some tools for helping us to do that. Here, a big thanks to Carlisia Campos and William Kennedy, [GoBridge][1] in general, people from our Go branch who have found a Nice tool: [BigMarker][2].

BigMarker is a paid tool, we got a sponsorship from [Hired.com][3] which helped us to pay for the [Remote Meetup Channel][4]. Attendees interactions will be better. After the first meetups, we got a sponsorship from BigMarker itself and now we have a paid account up to 1000 attendees! It's awesome!

Go Branch got a sponsorship from Compose.io, which helped them to pay [their own channel][5]. There is so much happening on the Go side.

### Helping Meetups around the World

Another idea we got on-the-fly was helping meetups. We are partner of two Meetups around the world: ParisRb - the biggest meetup in Europe. Green Ruby - A cool meetup in Taipei, Taiwan! These meetups can use our channel and livestream their meetups. If you know a local community that would benefit from our setup, feel free to [contact us][10].

### Elm Remote Meetup

[DailyDrip][6] has [planned][7] an Elm Remote Meetup. We are also partner with DailyDrip. They did the first ever Elm Remote Meetup, and many after that, checkout their [Elm Remote Meetups][8] page.

### Join Us

We are really happy with how things turn out. But we still can use all the help we can have. If you feel like it, [join our slack group][11] and use the channel #organizers!

To complete, I would like to say a big thanks for everyone, specially: Iuri Fernandes, Carlisia Campos, William Kennedy, Josh Adams, Mose, Filipe Costa, Narayan Chowdhury, Rafael Sales, Tad Hosford, Sebastian Sogamoso, João Moura, Lucas Amaral, André Mota and all the people from our Slack channel!
