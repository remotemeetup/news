# How is it going with Remote Meetups?

It's been a while that you have logged in our Slack Channel. I would like to
just to say how we are going and the latest updates!

Doing a Remote Meetup is a little bit difficult, because users report don't
have the same feeling as a real meetup. For this reason, We were looking for
some tools for helping us to do that. Here, a big thanks to Carlisia Campos
and William Kennedy, [GoBridge][1] in general, people from our Go branch who
have found a Nice tool: [BigMarker][2].

BigMarker is a paid tool, we got a sponsorship from [Hired.com][3] which
helped us to pay this Main Channel for Remote Meetup. [Channel is here!][4]
Using this, the attendees interaction will be better. If you want, you can
subscribe to this channel and get the latest meetups! We have a paid account
up to 100 users.

Go Branch got a sponsorship from Compose.io, which helped them to pay [their
own channel][5]. It means, all the Remote Meetups from Go will be centralised
in a single channel and not the Main Channel. BTW, if you want to learn Go,
it's time! A lot of awesome upcoming meetups in the next weeks!

## Helping Meetups around the World

Another idea we got on-the-fly was helping meetups. We are partner of two
Meetups around the world: ParisRb - the biggest meetup in Europe. Green Ruby -
A cool meetup in Taipei, Taiwan! These meetups can use or channel and
livestream their meetups.

## Elm Remote Meetup

[DailyDrip][6] is [planning][7] to create a Elm Remote Meetup. We are also
partner with DailyDrip. They will be using our Channel and using Remote Meetup
to do that!
