<h1>How is it going with Remote Meetups?</h1>

<p>It's been a while that you have logged in our Slack Channel. I would like to just to say how we are going and the latest updates!</p>

<p>Doing a Remote Meetup is a little bit difficult, because users report don't have the same feeling as a real meetup. For this reason, We were looking for some tools for helping us to do that. Here, a big thanks to Carlisia Campos and William Kennedy, <a href="http://golangbridge.org">GoBridge</a> in general, people from our Go branch who have found a Nice tool: <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com">BigMarker</a>.</p>

<p>BigMarker is a paid tool, we got a sponsorship from <a href="https://hired.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=remotemeetup&amp;utm_campaign=q2-16">Hired.com</a> which helped us to pay this Main Channel for Remote Meetup. <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup">Channel is here!</a> Using this, the attendees interaction will be better. If you want, you can subscribe to this channel and get the latest meetups! After some meetups, we got a sponsorship from BigMarker itself and now we have a paid account up to 1000 attendees! It's awesome!</p>

<p>Go Branch got a sponsorship from Compose.io, which helped them to pay <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup-go">their own channel</a>. It means, all the Remote Meetups from Go will be centralised in a single channel and not the Main Channel. BTW, if you want to learn Go, it's time! A lot of awesome upcoming meetups in the next weeks!</p>

<h2>Helping Meetups around the World</h2>

<p>Another idea we got on-the-fly was helping meetups. We are partner of two Meetups around the world: ParisRb - the biggest meetup in Europe. Green Ruby - A cool meetup in Taipei, Taiwan! These meetups can use or channel and livestream their meetups.</p>
