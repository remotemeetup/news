<div class="baseline"><h2>How is it going with Remote Meetups?</h2>

<p>It's been a while that you have logged in our Slack Channel. I would like to just to say how we are going and the latest updates!</p>

<h3>Now on BigMarker</h3>

<p>Doing a Remote Meetup is a little bit difficult, because users report don't have the same feeling as a real meetup. For this reason, We were looking for some tools for helping us to do that. Here, a big thanks to Carlisia Campos and William Kennedy, <a href="http://golangbridge.org">GoBridge</a> in general, people from our Go branch who have found a Nice tool: <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com">BigMarker</a>.</p>

<p>BigMarker is a paid tool, we got a sponsorship from <a href="https://hired.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=remotemeetup&amp;utm_campaign=q2-16">Hired.com</a> which helped us to pay for the <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup">Remote Meetup Channel</a>. Attendees interactions will be better. After the first meetups, we got a sponsorship from BigMarker itself and now we have a paid account up to 1000 attendees! It's awesome!</p>

<p>Go Branch got a sponsorship from Compose.io, which helped them to pay <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup-go">their own channel</a>. There is so much happening on the Go side.</p>

<h3>Helping Meetups around the World</h3>

<p>Another idea we got on-the-fly was helping meetups. We are partner of two Meetups around the world: ParisRb - the biggest meetup in Europe. Green Ruby - A cool meetup in Taipei, Taiwan! These meetups can use our channel and livestream their meetups. If you know a local community that would benefit from our setup, feel free to <a href="mailto:info@remotemeetup.com">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3>Elm Remote Meetup</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.dailydrip.com/">DailyDrip</a> has <a href="https://www.dailydrip.com/blog/organizing-a-remote-meetup-for-elm">planned</a> an Elm Remote Meetup. We are also partner with DailyDrip. They did the first ever Elm Remote Meetup, and many after that, checkout their <a href="https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elm-remote-meetup">Elm Remote Meetups</a> page.</p>

<p>We are really happy with how things turn out. But we still can use all the help we can have. If you feel like it, <a href="http://remotemeetup.herokuapp.com/">join our slack group</a> and use the channel #organizers!</p>
