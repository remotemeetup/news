  "# How is it going with Remote Meetups?


It's been a while that you have logged in our Slack Channel. I would like to
just to say how we are going and the latest updates!


Doing a Remote Meetup is a little bit difficult, because users report don't
have the same feeling as a real meetup. For this reason, We were looking for
some tools for helping us to do that. Here, a big thanks to Carlisia Campos
and William Kennedy, [GoBridge][1] in general, people from our Go branch who have
found a Nice tool: [BigMarker][2].


BigMarker is a paid tool, we got a sponsorship from [Hired.com][3] which helped us
to pay this Main Channel for Remote Meetup. [Channel is here!][4] Using this, the
attendees interaction will be better. If you want, you can subscribe to this
channel and get the latest meetups! We have a paid account up to 100 users.


Go Branch got a sponsorship from Compose.io, which helped them to pay
[their own channel][5]. It means, all the Remote Meetups from Go will be centralised
in a single channel and not the Main Channel. BTW, if you want to learn Go,
it's time! A lot of awesome upcoming meetups in the next weeks!


## Helping Meetups around the World


Another idea we got on-the-fly was helping meetups. We are partner of two
Meetups around the world: ParisRb - the biggest meetup in Europe. Green Ruby -
A cool meetup in Taipei, Taiwan! These meetups can use or channel and
livestream their meetups.


## Elm Remote Meetup


[DailyDrip][6] is [planning][7] to create a Elm Remote Meetup. We are also partner
with DailyDrip. They will be using our Channel and using Remote Meetup to do that!
